/*Utopias tax accountants always use programs that compute income 
taxes even though the tax rate is a solid, 
never-changing 15%. Define the program
calculateTax which determines the tax on the gross pay. Define
calculateNetPay that determines the net pay of an employee
from the number of hours worked. Assume an hourly rate of $12.*/
